# Vektr

## Car sharing web application, developed with GatbsyJS

In this project, I have created a presentation website for a car sharing business called Vektr, using GatsbyJS for generating a static website. The structure of this project allows changing the displayed data without having the need for it to be stored in a CMS, making it very easy to adapt and change the business behind the website. 

The live demo for this application can be found here: https://fromzerotocicero-vektr.netlify.app/.
